## Gambling.com Group Dev Code Test

Hi, thanks for the chance to get good work at a great company.

On this branch (production), you can see my test work.

What was done:
- An attempt to make something like MVC (Classes Sphere, Point)
- A couple of simple Tests (Unit and Feature)
- Basic HTML output (route http://localhost:8000/data)

Was used a Laravel 8 and the original txt file as input.

MySQL and other databases are not been used.

Best regards,

Vlad Rastvorov
